# MumeiAirsoftSight
Modified 3D printable airsoft sight, which has space for a printed PNG of Mumei to be your reticle for you. If you're actually going to print this PLEASE use clear resin, don't be at a disadvantage because a giant Mumei without a transparent background is blocking your right side of vision

I will update this README in the future to be more descriptive and maybe a tutorial but keyword: in the future, eventually I will
